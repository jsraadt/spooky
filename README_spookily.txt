This GitHub Repository has three files: spookyR.R, WBB_Accused.csv, and WDB_Case.csv.

These files are for a workshop on using the R statitical computing and programming lagnuage.

This workshop was presented on October 31, 2019 at The University of North Texas.

The .R file is a script for introducing some data manipulation and data analysis in R.

Both of the .csv files are part of the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft (SSW) database (1563 to 1736).

The database was authored by Julian Goodare, Lauren Martin, Joyce Miller, and Louise Yeoman in January 2003

Go to http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches/ for more information.

For the .R script to work correctly, you must have the .csv files available.

Enjoy, and don't forget that those unjustly accused of witchcraft were mostly women. Now that's spooky.
